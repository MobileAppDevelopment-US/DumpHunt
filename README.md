# DumpHunt

This is my volunteer project. His goal is to complain about landfills and other environmental violations.

This application is designed to publicly monitor the work of the regional waste management operator of the Arkhangelsk region, as well as those enterprises or specific individuals that harm the environment.

If you notice that:
- garbage is not removed in a timely manner,
- waste is unloaded into a forest belt or discharged into water bodies,
- the fuel spilled,
- medical waste or car tires (batteries, fluorescent lamps, etc.) are littered in inappropriate places for this purpose;
- someone is illegally logging or poaching,
- commits other violations of environmental laws,

Just take a picture of the object of violation, mark the coordinates on the map and optionally describe a problem in a couple of words. The editors of the Ecology Pomerania project Ecolog29.ru will process your letter and send requests to the body that is authorized to eliminate the violation.
